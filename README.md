**Python Test Framework with Behave, Playwright, and BehaveX**

A robust test automation framework built with Python, utilizing Behave for BDD, Playwright for browser automation, and BehaveX for parallel execution. The framework supports Allure and BehaveX HTML for reporting, and integrates seamlessly with Elasticsearch and Kibana for advanced test result analysis and visualization.

# Setup
1. Execute `pip3 install -r requirements.tx`
2. Set up allure-report
   ```
      # Linux
    Download from https://allurereport.org/docs/install-for-linux/
    Execute: sudo dpkg -i allure_*_all.deb
    Execute: allure --version
   ```
   Ref Link: https://allurereport.org/docs/install/
3. Execute `playwright install` (To install Playwright browsers)
4. Setup `resources/details.ini` as
   ```
      delete_old_reports = true [false]
      start_docker_compose = false [/true] (if false then framwork assumes selenium is running already. Required only if PLaywright is ruuning on Selenium)
      password_for_sshpass = "passowrd" (this has no affect but can be useful if anyone want to start docker-compose where sudo is required)
      headless = true [/false]
      allow_tracing = true [/false]
      tags =  (Provide specifi tag like tags = @QA-1)
      add_in_elk = false [/true] (if true then framework assuemes elastic search is running)
                  - if add_in_elk is true the set elk_url = https://elk.com
      send_report_on_email = true [/false]
                  - if send_report_on_email is true the provide below:
                        - token =  (Check Notes -> 'Create Gmail Key Password' to generate Token)
                        - sender_email = sender@gmail.com
                        - receiver_email = receiver@gmail.com
      selenium_host_ip =  (Selenium host - required only if PLaywright is ruuning on Selenium)
      browser = Chrome [/Firefox]
      url = https://www.saucedemo.com      
   ```
